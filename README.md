### **Overview**

This project addresses the growing demand for Korean language education among Japanese native speakers. As the number of Japanese learners of Korean continues to rise, accurate pronunciation remains a significant challenge, with limited resources tailored to Japanese speakers. This project combines **Whisper** and **Wav2Vec 2.0** to build an effective pronunciation correction system. Whisper determines the intended pronunciation, while Wav2Vec 2.0 analyzes the actual phonetic output, effectively identifying discrepancies and providing feedback. Additionally, **language detection** is used to handle code-switching between Korean and Japanese, ensuring high accuracy in mixed-language conversations.

### **Features**

- **Market Demand-Driven Solution**: Responds to the rapid growth of Korean learners in Japan, where existing resources often lack focus on pronunciation training.
- **Error Detection**: Detects specific pronunciation errors by comparing intended versus actual phonemes.
- **Targeted Feedback**: Provides corrective suggestions designed for Japanese speakers learning Korean.
- **Language Detection**: Handles code-switching (混合言語), making it compatible with conversations that switch between Korean and Japanese.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible via a web interface built with Streamlit.

### **Installation**

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fairyofdata/JP2KR_PhonemeTutor
   cd fairyofdata/JP2KR_PhonemeTutor
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended).
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - If using Whisper’s API, make sure to set up and configure your OpenAI API key.
   - Add your API key to your environment variables or a `.env` file.

### **Usage**

Once installed, you can use the system as follows:

1. **Running the Web Interface**:
   - Start the Streamlit app for a user-friendly interface.
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Uploading Audio Files**:
   - Users can upload audio files (e.g., extracted from conversation videos).
   - The system will automatically detect code-switching and separate Korean and Japanese sections.

3. **Receiving Pronunciation Feedback**:
   - After processing, the system displays targeted feedback for incorrect pronunciations, highlighting specific phonemes and syllables that require improvement.

---

### **Example**

Here’s a step-by-step example of how to use the system:

1. **Upload an audio file** where a Japanese speaker is speaking Korean. Make sure the audio is clear for better results.
2. **The system detects intended pronunciation** using Whisper and analyzes actual pronunciation with Wav2Vec 2.0.
3. **View Feedback**: The output will highlight the mispronounced syllables and provide recommendations for improvement.

**日本語説明 (Japanese Explanation)**:
1. **オーディオファイルをアップロードしてください**。日本人話者が韓国語を話している音声です。
2. **意図した発音をWhisperが分析し**、Wav2Vec 2.0が実際の発音を確認します。
3. **フィードバックを受け取る**：間違った発音箇所が強調表示され、改善のためのアドバイスが提供されます。
